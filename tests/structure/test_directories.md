# Conceptual Failing Test for Directory Structure

## Test Case: Missing Core Directories

**Purpose:** To verify that the expected core directories (`utils`, `examples`) are present.

**Current State (Failing Test Criteria):**
*   Absence of a `utils/` directory at the project root.
*   Absence of an `examples/` directory at the project root.

This test will be considered "failing" until the `utils/` and `examples/` directories are created at the project root.
