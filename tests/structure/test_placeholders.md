# Conceptual Failing Test for Placeholder Files

## Test Case: Missing Placeholder Files

**Purpose:** To verify that the expected placeholder files (`utils/readme.md`, `examples/readme.md`) are present.

**Current State (Failing Test Criteria):**
*   Absence of a `utils/readme.md` file.
*   Absence of an `examples/readme.md` file.

This test will be considered "failing" until the `utils/readme.md` and `examples/readme.md` files are created.
